int float double -> data type
if for while -> controll flow
new -> operator

int = integer variable
String = charactor variable

data type is used for declearing variable or functions of diff types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how much space it occupies in storage. 

1 byte = 1 cell of ram = 8 bit. 7 but is tge data set. max = 127, min = -128
sign bit 0 means number is +ve 
Sign bit 1 means number is -ve

type conversion = explit conversion(done bye jvm), implisit conversion(done by dev).

base value of a decimal is 10.(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
base value of a binary is 2.(0,1)
base value of octal is 8.(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
base value of hexa deciam is 16.(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)

unicode charactor is total of 65536, in this group only 256 are ascii code

int is primitive type, Integer is Wrapper class. Wrapper class provide more feature and make java fully OOP.

what is constant: its a value thst cannot be changed after it is defined.In programming constants are used to store values that are meant to remain the same throughout the execution of a program.

float f =20.5f;(suffix)
double d=20.5


floating point memory representation
step 1: make binary of that number
step 2: make first floating point space.
step 3: mantisa and exponent


Control flow: 
if = this used to execute code if some condition is there;
else if = this is used to execute code if the if condition is false.

for loop are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop;
while loop is used to execute statement repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
