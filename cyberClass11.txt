open port - the port is actively listening for incoming connections.
closed port - the port is not active or has no service runnig on it.
filtered - a firewall or security rule is blocking the port, preventing it from being detected as open or closed.
unfiltered - the port is accessible but its state cannot be determined.
open|filtered - the port might be open, but a firewall is interfering with its detection.
closed|filtered - thr port is either closed or filtered, making it unclear whether ts actively blocked or simply not in use.

ICMP Echo Scan(ping scan):
    used to determine if a host is online by sending icmp echo requestes
    nmap -sn <target ip>
    eg: nmap -sn 192.168.1.1
ICP connect scan(FUll open scan):
    performs a full 3-way handshake
    nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
TCP syn scan:
    sends only a syn packet. if the port is open the server replied with syn-ack, but the scanner does not complete the handshake(no ack).
    nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
Null, XMAS, and FIN scans:
    sends a packet with no tcp flags set. if the port is closed, the target replies with RST.
    nmap -sN 192.168.1.1
XMAS Scan(FIN, PSH, URG Flags set):
    sends a packet 
    nmap -sX<tareget>
FIN scan
    nmap sF<target>
UDP scan:
    nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
ports scan:
    nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
    all ports nmap -p-
Service version detection
    nmap -sV -O 192.168.1.1
Aggressive Scan:
    syn scan, service detection, OS detection, Traceroute
    nmap -A{target ip}
IDLE Scan(Stealth Scan):
    it uses zombi host to host to scan the target
    nmap -sl {zombi ip} {target ip}
