SQL vs RDBMS
    SQL and RDBMS are closely related but not the same.
    SQL is a language used to manage and query data in relational databases.
    RDBMS is a software to 

SQL command:
    DDL(data defination language) - CREATE, AFTER, DROP, RENAME, TRUNCATE
    DML(data manupulation language) - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT
    DCL(data control language) - GRANT, REVOKE
    TCL(trasaction control language) - SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK, COMMIT

DDL applied over the structure. 

command to set primary key:
    alter table TableName add constraint pk Primary Key(Eid);
Insert the above records:
    insert into EMP values(100,'jitu',1000,'Manager',10);
Insert multiple records:
    insert into EMP values(100,'jitu',1000,'Manager',10),(100,'jitu',1000,'Manager',10);
display all records:
    select * from emp;
    display empid, empname, sal from table;
    display empid, empname, sal of table;
Command to print row number:
    slect *,ROW_NUMBER() OVER() rn from emp;
Command to print last 1 records:
    select *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() as rn from emp order by rn desc limit 1;
display last record of emp table without using key
    select *, ROw_NUMBER() OVER() as rn from emp over 

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN, SELF JOIN.

Select * from test1, test2;
Select * form test1, test2 where test1.slno=test.slno;
Select * from test1,test2 where test1.slno < test2.slno;

A stored Procedure is a precompiled SQL code that can be executed multiple times. It helps in reusing SQL queries improving performance and maintaining secutiry.
    it improves performace 
    security
    code reusability
    faster execution
    tansaction management

delimiter Changes ";" to $$(anything)
create procedure show_emp()
    ->begin
    ->select * from emp;
    ->end
    ->$$
