java presistence API(JPA) is a specification in java for managing relational data in application using object-relational data in application using object rather than raw sql queries.

the key features of JPA
Object-relational mapping(ORM): maps java classes to database tables.
Annotations: Uses @Entity, @Table, @Id, and other annotations for mapping. 
Entity Manager API: Provides CURD Operations(presist(),find(),remove(),etc).
JPQl

Popular JPA Implementations
    Hibernate(most widely used)
JPA is just a specification while hibernate is an Implementation of jpa with extra features.
JPA provides guidelines but hibernate extends JPA with additional capabilities like native sql queries and advanced chach

type            API(interface)                              An implementation of JPA + additional feature.
Definition
Implementation  Needs an implementation                     Implements JPA and adds extra ORM features
                like Hibernate, Eclipselink,
                or OpenJPA                  

Query Language  JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)      Supports JPQL+ HOL (Hibernate Query Language)
Caching         Defines caching but doesn't implement it    Supports multiple caching mechanisms (First-Level, Second-Level)
Configuration   Requires a persistence.sel file             Uses hibernate.cgf.xml configuration
Vendor-Specific Limited to JPA-defined leature              Provides additional features like caching strategies, batch processing, and                                                         native SQL support
Features         
Performance     Standard ORM behavior                       Optimized with extra performance features

Hibernate is an ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) framework for java that simplifies database operations by mapping java objects to database tables.

Session Factory - Manages database connections.
session - Used to platform CURD operations.
Transaction - Handles database transactions.
Query - used to write HQL
Configuration- loads hibernate.cgf.xml
