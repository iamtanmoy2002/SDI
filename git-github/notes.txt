git is a software specifically it is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code colaborate with others and manage software development efficiently.

git works with github
pip works with pypi

github is a web-based platform for hosting, managing, and collaborating on git repository. it provides a remote server for storing code tracking changes and working with teams.

it supports programming in multiple language and integrates with various tools for project management, devops, and ci/cd.

Types of source code management:
    1. Centralised (cvcs)
    2. Distributed 

Drawback of cvcs:
    its not locally available meaning you always have to connect to be connected to a network to perfom any action.


echo "# SDI" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/iamtanmoy2002/SDI.git
git push -u origin main

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/iamtanmoy2002/SDI.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

in github a branch is a paralle version of a repository. it allows you to work on different features, fixes or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

git branch              :lists all local branches in git repo
git branch -a           :lists all branches in git repo including both local and remote branches.
git branch branchName   :create a branch with that branch name.
git checkout branchName :switches to branch.
