task 15: what is java decompiler


polymorphism means many + forms
its three times
    compiletime
    runtime 
    method hiding

    class Pclass{
        public int i=100;
    }
    class Cclass extends Pclass{
        public int i=200;
    }
    class code{
        public static void main(String[] arg){
            Pclass g = new Pclass();
            System.out.println(g.i); 
        }
    }

Method overrring:
    multiple method having the same name same parameter with virtual of parent method and override of child method in different class with inheritance is known as method overring mechanism.

virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, or event declared in the base class and allow it to be

the method present within a parent a parent class with virtual the same method present into child class with override keyword.
note: virtual and override keyword applicable over the member function not applicable over the data member.

abstract class:
    An abstract that is decleared but not defigned in the class. this can have data member abstract method, method body, constructor and even main() method.
    The abstract is used to declass the common characteristics of subclasses. it cant be instantiated 
    abstract class <class_name>{
        ...
    }

incomplete class:
    if a method is incomplete indise a class that class is also tereated as incomplete class.

    interface similar to abstract class. it has only static constants and abstract methods. there are mainly following reason to use inter face 

The java compiler converts methods of interface as public and abstract, data members as public, final and static by default.

the implements keywordis used to implement an interface.

a class implements interface but one interface extends another interface

default methods in therface were introduced with java 8 to allow interfaces to have method implementation.

defigned using the default keyword
implementation in interface
can be overridden
avoids code duplication.
