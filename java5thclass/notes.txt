Array is a collection of similar type of elements that have continuous memory location, which is generally used to prepare a list.

Linear search:
    suppose the data is to be searched is 57 in array= [11,2,9,13,57,25,7,33], 
        compare a[0] with 57 = data not found as a[0] is 11
        compare a[0] with 57 = data not found as a[0] is 2
        compare a[0] with 57 = data not found as a[0] is 9
        compare a[0] with 57 = data not found as a[0] is 12
        compare a[0] with 57 = returns 57

bubble sort:
    run 2 loops 
        check if curr element is greater than its next
            if yes swap them
            if not then dont swap, move to next element

inheritance is a machanism to access the data and function of a parent. Its used to create relation between onjects. 
    class Address{
        plot;
        district;
    }

    class Employee extends Address{
        eid;
        ename;
    }

    class Shop extends Address{
        sid;
        sname;
    }

The class from which properties and behaviour are inherited is base class or parent class.
The class to which the properties and behaviour are inheritance to is child class
    its used to implement relation between classes.
    if all attribute enables code reusability and extensibility.
    if all attribute is required to another class.

Types of inheritance:
    single:
        class A{}
        class B extends A{}
    multilevel:
        class A{}
        class B extends A{}
        class C extends B{}
    multiple:
        class A{}
        class B{}
        class C extends A,B{}
    Hierarchical:
        class A{}
        class B extends A{}
        class C extends A{}
        class D extends A{}
    Hybrid:
        class A{}
        class B extends A{}
        class c extends B,C{}
    Multipath:
        class A{}
        class B extends A{}
        class C extends A{}
        class D extends C,B{}

Super keyword:
    it allows access to members of parent class
            access parent class Constructor
            access parent class methods
            access parent class fields

Whats not inherited ?
    in java inheritance allows a class(subclass) to acquire the properties and methods, but private members, Constructors, static methos and final methods cant be inherited
