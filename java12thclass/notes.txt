    Function<String,Integer> lengthFunction = String::length;
    System.out.println

    consumer<T>:
        import java.util.function.*;
        public class Main{
            public static void main(string[] args){
                Consumer<String> 
            }
        }
    Supplier<T>
    BiFunction<T,U,R>
