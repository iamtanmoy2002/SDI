Object oriented programming allows programmers to create their own object that have methods and attributes

adv of OOP:
modular base 
Reusability
Maintainibility
Scalability

OOP is repeatable and organized

class is a collection of data member and function member encapsulated in single entitiy. its a blue print of a object. its used to create user define data type. 
syntax:
    class ClassName{
        data_member;
        member_function;
    }

Programmer point of view object is the memory location. its a physical existance of a class
syntax:
    ClassName obj = new ClassName();

in java object size are same but in python object size is not fixed. 
    in python:
    class Employee:
        pass
    e1=Employee()
    setattr(e1, "eid", 100)
    e2=Employee()
    setattr(e2, "eid", 200)
    setattr(e3, "ename", "prabin")

Class Attribute / Static Data member:
    class attribute allocate memory inside class
    class attribute can be enjoyed by class also can be enjoyed by object. 
    class attribute is also known as static data member. 
Instance Attribute / non static data member
    instance attribute allocate memory inside object.
    instance attribute only can be enjoyed by object can not be enjoyed by class.
    instance attribute is also known as non static data member. it allocate memory when create the object of class.

in java "final" variable is constant variable

Methof is a collection of expression and statements, A methof is a block of code which only runs when it is  called. you can pass data, known as parameteres, into a method. Methods are used to perform certain actions.
ovj of method resue a block of code many time.

Method overloading: 
    multiple method 
    having the same ClassName
    different parameteres

Constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize new value to the state/attribute/data member.
